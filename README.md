## Overview
### Description
This app will use different API's to collect IT related job postings. The user will be able to search for specific job postings related to their field, save job postings, and follow a link to apply for the job.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity / Business
- **Mobile:** We want to develop the app primarily for mobile and have a companion desktop app. We want the user to be able to find job postings on mobile, and if the job doesn't have easy apply, the user can continue applying on a desktop.
- **Story:** Lets the user search for IT jobs while on the go and lets them save or apply for the job. A desktop companion app would allow the user to apply for a job saved on the mobile app if the process is too hard on mobile.
- **Market:** Anyone looking for an job in an IT related field.
- **Habit:** Job seekers would be using this app throughout the day to look up new job postings or access existing job aplications.
- **Scope:** V1 Allow the user to search for job postings from different API's then  V2
